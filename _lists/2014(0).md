## SCAV TEAMS AND THE RULES OF THE HUNT

1. The Year. 2014(0), in the great Scav tradition of 2014(1) and 2014(2). Unsurprisingly, it is a leap year.

1. The Scavvenyear. We decided four days weren't enough. The gracious Judges have packed an entire 366-day year between List Release (New Year's Day, starting 00:00 CT on Thursday) to Results-ish (New Year's Eve, ending 19:30 CT on Sunday). From this point onward, normie-time rules don't apply. Good luck, folks!

1. Acquisition of Items. All Items on the List can be obtained and performed legally. It may involve smooth talking, or it may involve something else, but it is all possible. The Judges take no responsibility for your getting thrown into the clink---be it local clink, state clink, federal clink, or Colonel Klink. If you end up there, it is your fault. 
	
1. Covid. Listen, the Administration may say that we can’t require you to do certain things, but here at Scav we like to do our own thing. Masks will be provided at every indoor event. Judges and Scavvies have a right to their personal space. Please self---monitor and be responsible for yourself---the Judges are doing our best to keep you all safe, but we can’t do that without everyone being mindful and conscientious.

1. Fair Play. Sabotage is bad. We don't like it, and we don't want it in the Hunt. Sabotaging teams or their Items can lead to immediate disqualification, and we may even loose the hounds of the Administration on you.
	
1. Contact with Judges. While we don't want to complain and say that Judges have it *so* tough, Scav Hunt is always teetering on the edge of sheer chaos, and, if we can avoid it, we should. Thus, please only communicate with the Judges if you are going to do it in a professional manner. Generally, just remember that the more people shout, the less will be understood. That seems like it makes sense, no?
	
1. Props. All props must, always and forever, be mad props.
	
1. Points. Point totals are final. We ask you to do awesome things and expect awesome things to be done. If you do said awesome things, the Judge will accord to you Full Points, the highest number of points possible for any Item. In rare cases---for example, if we ask for a car and you give us the Batmobile with both George Clooney *and* Adam West inside---we will consider giving you one special point. Maybe two. As far as point values, well, we use a dartboard, numberwang, and Tibetan numerological methods to determine how much Items are worth, so no complaining that "the lazy eye patch was worth more than the moonbounce made of guns!"
	
1. Items. Be aware that doing Items nude when it's not explicitly asked for will not get you more points. Nor will involving alcohol in Items that don't clearly call for alcohol. The same goes for alcohol's redheaded, stepchild cousins, sex and drugs.  Please note that few Items explicitly call for nudity, alcohol, or either of the aforementioned redheaded variants. Lastly, we don't like to harm large mammals that can make sad eyes at us, so please treat any non-humans involved in your Items with extreme care.
	
1.  A Good Time. For a good time call (202) 762-1401. It's not the right time, but it is a good one.
	
1. Preliminary Events. The deadlines for the submission of Items and performances are final as stated on the List or as announced by the Judges at 3:10 to Punxsutawney, which happens on Groundhog Day (sometimes erroneously described as 8:00 AM) in Hutch Commons. It is the Captains' responsibility to make sure that they submit these in a timely manner. Items that do not have a discrete date/place/email stated on the List are not preliminary and therefore must occur at Judgment. Upon request, we may, at our discretion, come to see an Item at a time/place other than Judgment. Consider this a privilege, and use your "Come See Our Items" cards sparingly.

1. Judgment Day.
As in the Bible, Judgment Day should take, like, three days. Regular Items will be judged after the Showcase. The Showcase will be judged at Showcase, which will be on November 24th. \
In addition, please have a highlighted list of the Items you've acquired ready so that when a Judge comes by to judge your page, there won't be any time wasted with "do we have the particle accelerator?" questions. If an Item is followed by $\dagger$, it must be ready for judging as part of the Showcase, prior to regular page judging. Judges will hold up placards (really just sheets of paper with Sharpie-ed numbers) denoting which pages they are ready to judge. Call over whichever Judge corresponds to the page you are ready to present. Here's a tip: sort your Items based on which page they are on. In short, BE ORGANIZED.
	
1. Rules. Ain't no rule says a train roller coaster can't be a Judge.
	
1. Prizes. The prizes are simple: we bought some random shit we liked on eBay et al. Offer void where prohibited. Check local laws.

1. Decisions. All decisions of the Judges are final. Final.
	
1. Final. See Decisions.

## Scav Olympics

There's 104 days of summer vacation, and school comes along just to end it. So the annual problem for our Scavvies is finding a good way to spend it. To make the most of this summer, join us on August 16th at Eckhart Quad.
For each competition, 30 points will be awarded for 1<sup>st</sup> place; 20 points for
2<sup>nd</sup> place; 10 points for 3<sup>rd</sup> place; 2 points for 2 points for $>$ 3<sup>rd</sup> place.

1. Boba shooting---no evil gelatin monster allowed here.

1. Ever been coming home with groceries, then your deranged teenager pulls you to the backyard? No? Well, ever been at the grocery store bagging your groceries, then run out to catch the bus? This is pretty much like that.

1. What’s the farthest you and a teammate can flip a pancake? Bring said cake and two pans. You choose the distance and have one shot, and only successful pan-to-pan transfers count, so be strategic. No Paul Bunyan’s Pancake Haus allowed (where the food is good, but not too good, eh?)

1. For too long Air Bud has had all of the fun, but the turn tables at Olympics this year! Ain’t no rule that says a Scavvie on all fours can’t participate in a dog show! Let’s just hope you do better than Doofenshmirtz and Perry$\dots$

1. Remember the Ballad of Bad Beard? Well, it's time to put your folk song skills to the test. A big-leagues “Jenny Jenkins”-off. You might want to think of a few challenging colors in advance; a pre-bought foldy-roldy is optional.

1. Like Grandpa Clyde taught us: We’re all going on a lion hunt! But we’re not scared! ‘Cause we are CAMPERS! And we know two words: left, right, left, right, left, right, left!

## Items

1. A copy of the 2014(0) University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt List. [1 point]

1. Stepping out of your time machine on May 11, 2014(0), you rush into the nearest building---Rosenwald---dressed in your futuristic attire. You ask the first person you see the question burning on your mind: What year is it? Upon hearing the answer, you disappointedly run out, get back into your time machine, and recalibrate. [You are from the year 4.253 points]

1. Do you hear the people sing, singing the song of angry men? Please construct a contraption that I can wear that causes a drum to be struck at the same rate as my heartbeat. [‘32 points]

1. It’s summer! The season of Strawberry Socials! But why stop at a Strawberry Social? We want a full-bloomed Fruit Festival! The seed of your preparation should be one unique fruit that you'll announce at 3:10 to Punxsutawney. Your celebration will be fleshed out by a cake for the cakewalk, a pageantry participant decked out in thematic dress, a photo stand-in, and a homemade carnival game with fruity prizes. Meet us at the center quad on June 13<sup>th</sup>, and we'll have an ovary good time! [The fruits of your labors will be awarded with $\omega$ points]

1. TBA. [5.0.6 points] 

1. You’re not here to start no trouble, you’re just here to do the ScavO Shuffle! [7 points for before ScavO, 5 points for after ScavO] 

1. Lisa and Stefan’s date at the Vienna fair may have ended blissfully, but their story certainly did not. It’s time to give this unknown woman the train ride she deserves. Using the same bike mechanism, present the deluxe crankie locomotive experience to a train car of Judges, with at least three different crankie layers moving at different speeds. Please note that Scav trains are not limited by space or time, so show us the countryside of your choice. [200 points] $\dagger$ 

1. Why, thank you for those heartfelt cards celebrating Penguin Awareness Day (January 20\th), International Plastic Bag Free Day (July 3\rd), Vanilla Cupcake Day (November 10\th), or, frankly, any three mostly-phony holidays, presented to a Judge on that holiday. [2 points each]

1. You mean to tell me that all we have to do to complete this Item is for everyone on our team to do their best evil laugh at Judgment? Mwhahahahahahahaha. [0.9 points]

1. Once more, it’s time for Skills Hunt! Send a fast-learning Scavvie to Eckhart Quad on February 20\th\ where they will be told the skill they are to learn and present at Judgment. No Scavvie substitutions will be allowed, so choose wisely. [17 points]

1. A Congreve clock that displays the time. Your completion may be largely electronic, but it must fundamentally be controlled by a ball repeatedly rolling down a reversible plane. [70 o'clock points]

1. Are you and a partner qualified to be elite hackers for *NCIS*? Show up to Bartlett Trophy Lounge on May 28th with a laptop to find out. No technical skills are necessary (or even helpful). [3 points for participation, 7/5/3 bonus points for 1\st/2\nd/3\rd]

1. A Judith Leiber-style \textit{mini}-audi\`ere, for when you want to be the chicest shopper at 6621 South Cottage Grove. It should snugly hold the quarter you need to obtain a shopping cart and look like a product sold there. As this is an Aldi Item rather than a Whole Foods Item, you may, should you so choose, replace the Swarovskis with sequins. [12 points]

1. Where in a retail establishment in Hyde Park can you find a mural of Harold Washington? [2 points]

1. The dead speak! In this other nearby depiction of the late mayor. Where can you find this more, er, unsettling version? [2 EYES points]

1. Hunt for an animal doctor in the Palmetto State and get them to show you proof of membership in their locale’s professional fraternal organization---you know which one. [Palm8o points]

1. You’ve got your lipstick on, here you come, da da dum. In particular, you are coming towards that blank canvas, because this Item is to create a painting of a punnet of strawberries using solely applied kisses. Please be sure to create a time-lapse video of your completion of this Item. [K11ss points]

1. What is this, a pillory for a ginger root? [6in6er points (by this, we mean 6.6 points)]

1. Your team, government approved. Get a .gov website to post an endorsement for your team. [Up to 17.76 points]

1. \textit{This is a Maroon Line train to Harper.} A Scavvie can dream, at least. \textit{Doors closing.} But then, we asked: why let our dreams be memes? \textit{Ryerson/Kent is next.} Your team’s 1600-series rolling stock should be built exactly to half the height and width specifications of a 3200-series L car (we will accept cars of variable lengths), and should be able to open and close its doors, display its destination, and broadcast live and recorded announcements about the route. \textit{In the direction of travel, doors open on the right at Ryerson/Kent.} In the name of “fun,” we also demand that every train be a CTA Holiday Train. \textit{This is Ryerson/Kent.} In the spirit of your holiday of choice, your team’s decor must be festive enough to deter the faint of heart from entering. \textit{This is a Maroon Line train to Harper.} Please arrange cars in accordance with the Gregorian calendar. [225 points] $\dagger$

On March 1\st, June 5\th, and September 9\th, meet the Judges in the Bartlett Trophy Lounge, and put your rote memory to the test! [Up to 5 points per Wordle instance]

1. We non-Catholic Judges were disappointed to learn that "beatification" does not mean recounting the life story of a Blessed over a sick trap beat… [7 deadly spoints]

1. We non-Catholic Judges were disappointed to learn that "canonization" does not mean shooting a facsimile of a Saint out of large artillery… [16 spoints]

1. Fuck those cans of Coors™ that change color when your beer is cold---who the hell wants a cold beer?? We British Judges disagree. A Guinness™ glass that emits a shrill scream when your beer is warm. [18 and older pouints]

1. Don’t you hate it when you get hit on the head with a "metal" bar so hard it bends into an exact outline of your head and shoulders? Sucks that a bunch of birds and/or stars start swirling around after it happens, also. [23.5 points + 10 bonus points if you also run through a wall that creates an exact outline of your body]

1. An official statement from The University of Chicago stating unequivocally that "The University of Chicago is full of assholes." [Points tiered based on the level of member that you get the letter from, max 34.5 points]

1. A small \textit{sekretiki} of this Hunt’s paraphernalia, to be surreptitiously revealed at Judgment. [9 points]

1. Did quilts really guide people on the Underground Railroad? The historical evidence may not be all there, but your quilt should still give us the directions we need.

Points given based on quality of quilt construction, aesthetic enjoyment, and success of autostereogram. [175 points] $\dagger$

1. \textit{The New England Journal of Medicine} has finally agreed to Dr. Leo Spaceman’s requests! Of course, though, as it is in the scientific publishing world, we hear that several other journals are plagiarizing this idea from the \textit{NEJM}. Please provide us with a six-panel sample from one of the following journals: \textit{Journal of Aquaculture and Fisheries Management, Bulletin of Volcanology,} the \textit{American Institute for Conservation, The Accounting Review, Journal of Transport and Land Use}. Don’t forget to cite your source, pervert. [8.0085+8.0085 points]

1. Have you ever woken up extra early before school or work to sit through an entire Ash Wednesday Mass only to walk away with a smudged blob on your forehead instead of a proper cross? You’d think the same religion that produces beautiful stained glass and the Sistine Chapel could be a bit more artistic. Come to Eckhart quad this Ash Wednesday with an artist and a model and demonstrate your artistic abilities. The medium? Palm ash we’ll provide to you. The canvas? Your Scavvie’s forehead. The image?

1. TBBFFA. [$\rho$ points]

1. We don’t know what was the big deal about that declassification of a trove of Kennedy assassination documents when we all know that his head just did that. Prove that his head just did that by creating a reproduction of this process with your very own JFK bust/head. While your recreation of his head just doing that MUST NOT involve any explosives or noxious chemical processes, the result of the process should transform the head such that it is as close as possible to the specifications outlined by JFK’s autopsy. [19.63 points]

1. TBA. [$\gamma$ points]  

1. Robert J. \textit{Tzimmes}. [3 points]

1. The octopus. Is it a bug or a tree? It wears many styles of armor. Is it a game or a sport? It plays both. Octopodes are not bugs, but, rather, art imitates life. [18 octoints for a theophanic work of art in your choice of medium]

1. Lutefisk (but it's pronounced like Ludacris. GET IT?) [\textit{Back for the 1 Point}]

1. The left brain is responsible for the right side of the body, logic, and Giants/Yankees/Knicks/Rangers fandom. The right brain is responsible for the left side of the body, creativity, and Jets/Mets/Nets/Islanders fandom. Come to Judgment in a 'fit that will satisfy both halves. [10.5 points]

1. Me-Mentos mori. [2 points]

1. There are 10 Items on this year's list with Item text that was written not by man, but machine! Submit your guesses for which Items Judge Turing wrote to scavaiguesses@gmail.com by Judgment. [2 points per correct guess]

1. TBA. [$\alpha\iota$ points] 

1. You're playing the world's smallest violin? Put your money where your mouth is and play the melody of "Ode to Joy" on your tiniest bowed string instrument. Smolness and functionality are the imperative factors for this completion, and you'd best believe that your "violin" should be tinier than the other teams'! [18 points]

1. A team member who is fit as a fiddle. That is, strung from head to toe, playing themselves with a bow. [27.5 points]

1. Sharp Cheerios™. [6 points]

1. TBA. [1 point]

1. Pants that beep when you back up. [8 points]

1. What is this, a working toilet for rodents? [25 points]

1. We’re down 500, partner is spitting mad, I am flipping the bidding box in rage. A Blackwood by any other name is not just as sweet. If only there was a way to generate an auction flowchart to match our bidding conventions\dots. [15 points]

1. A compendium of Pitbull chuckle sound effects, arranged from most to least goat-like. [5 points]

1. Food is the world's great equalizer, the lingua franca, the common thread, etc., and at this year's Scavvenfeast, it couldn't be any more obvious. First, we want to recognize the universality that is the humble noodle---for your appetizer, create a dish of homemade noodles using the form and composition of one cuisine and the style of preparation of another. Next, we must honor the common joy of a perfectly balanced sandwich, with each ingredient working together in harmony to create the ultimate bite. Taking inspiration from Ireland's rollóg bhricfeasta, an attempt to stuff a full breakfast into a handheld roll, prepare an original rollóg dinnéar from the country of your choosing, such that each "sandwich" ingredient represents a component of a traditional dinner. Finally, even though we might hoist different flags, there's nothing more ubiquitous than a rustic dessert made from homegrown ingredients. As a homage to Italian flag cookies and American flag cakes, create a dessert that not only showcases a region's local ingredients but uses them to create a colorful yet delicious facsimile of the flag that represents it. Bring an optional passport and non-optional appetite to Ida Noyes on September 23\rd. [$\mu$ points]

1. A can of Coke branded in the style of PBR. [10.5 points for art on the can, 4 points for a label on the can]

1. A Brooman is like a broom but is fundamentally also a human (like one who is getting pushed around on the end of a stick). Since tool usage is one of the defining traits of humans, so too shall broomans, despite their own status as tools, be encouraged to use second-order tools to help clean up after Judgment. [4 broomts (conversion rate: 1 broomt = 1 point)]

1. Taco Bell’s Canon in D. [3 points]

1. FINOGDIE OTGNMTGF REATEAOR TMNONKLO HBOJTEBM IRNUAAII SIIDNBTT. [3 points] 

1. Listen. All we want is to walk up to a computer, press a Function key, and have the corresponding \textit{Fast and Furious} trailer begin playing. Bonus points for a custom F[Hobbs and Shaw] keycap. [Fast 5oints + Bonus Furious Po3nts for a custom F[Hobbs \& Shaw] keycap]

1. A rubber chicken rubber. [6.9 points]

1. When we were young, we thought rain came from giant blimps that held big containers of water. They would release that water through two gratings that would cut back and forth to make separate droplets. Now that we’re older and wiser, we realize that all that water would make a blimp too heavy to fly, and instead the blimp might need to be held up by something to hold all that water. We also realize that blimps aren’t that big: maybe only the size of one’s yard or shower. But we’re pretty sure the rest is still feasible! [42.5 points]

1. Diner rules are in effect. Every Item on this page must be accompanied by a pickle spear, or else it will receive NO POINTS. [\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{C:/Users/llett/Documents/Scav/Photos for 2022/pickle.png}]

1. Oh, balderdash! Between the exquisite cane you’re gripping and the fancy pocket watch you’re checking, a gentle dandy like yourself has no free hands to give this poorly Judge a delightful piece of hard candy! Luckily, you are able to dispense sweet confections from your cane at the press of a conveniently placed button. [16 points]

1. The breakfast of champions: the interlocking Olympic bagels, in glorious color. [11 points]

1. This donut has too much cream filling. This donut is almost bursting with cream filling. This donut is so overflowing with cream filling that you could make the cream filling shoot out of it a considerable distance just by squeezing or hitting it. [8====Donut points]

1. Skaw! It’s ska, for birds. [7! It’s 7	 points, for you.]

1. A colossal cootie-catcher containing copious contingencies corresponding with the Cabal’s conferment, controlled by a crowd of Scav competitors. [Pick 4 different integers, with sum 20, in the range from -20 to 40, and add one value to each fortune’s detailed narrative.]

1. Lovingly render a beautiful "sand art" piece by layering appropriate ratios of the ingredients that make up any bottled/jarred food product, within its original clear container. Any liquid ingredients must have an appropriate dry substitute. [13 points]

1. A merkin for Cruella de Vil. [10.1 points]

1. Forget drinking wine from the skulls of your enemies we want you to trepan a skull that you’ve no affiliation with and stick a straw in it and slurp up some vanilla pudding hidden inside yum yum delicious and don’t forget to bring a second straw for the Judge that wants this to happen please and thank you so much. [So like\dots 9 points?]

1. Cash, Johnny. “Despacito.” \textit{American IV: The Man Comes Around.} American Recordings, 2002. CD. [4 points]

1. While \textit{Pok\`emon Legends: Arceus} was a hit, the graphics left plenty to be desired. We want realism. We want textures. We want a stone-carved Sudowoodo, a wood-carved Trevenant, and a gourd-carved Gourgeist. [You want 30, 23, and 7 points.]

1. A sugar baby. [15 points, ideally life-sized; 0 points for a real flesh human being]

1. One hydrodynamic spatula, with port-and-starboard attachments, and let’s not forget the TURBO DRIVE! Can you believe they only had one in stock? Show it off amidst the anchovies crowded within Ida, and satisfy this Judge’s appetite! [4 points]

1. Woah! We checked that very conspicuous spot and found a real live Gossip Stone! It bounces! It tells the time! It telepathically sends us gossip when we wear the corresponding Mask of Truth you have on hand! [35 points]

1. Do you remember? If so, meet us at 5723 South University Avenue [5.723 points]

1. \textit{Cause on my head, there’s a Greyhound station/where I send my thoughts to far-off destinations/also on four teammates’ heads, connected by roadways/and we even brought our own model bus!} [I do believe it’s true/that there are 15 points in both of our shoes]

1. The rubber hand illusion has gotten a little\dots limp. Convince us for the splittest of seconds that our hand exploded, disintegrated, metamorphosized, or experienced any other impressive feat. [17 points]

1. A Big Debbie dessert cake that’s able to blast my big-ass hunger, plus box art mock-up. Must be appropriate for Big Bois. GET SWOLE WITH BIG DEBBIE®: THEY’VE ALL GOT FUCKIN’ PROTEIN NOW™. [14 points, 0 points for a giant Oatmeal Creme Pie or jacked Zebra® Cakes]

1. What’s the password? [8 points]

1. Is your little Scavvie not so little anymore? Do they want a unique experience that prepares them for future success, building leadership skills and increasing maturity while still being the Scav experience they know and love (and maybe even influencing this year’s Hunt)? Whether they’re hoping to be a real Judge one day or just want to work on their Scav skills, the yearlong Judge-in-Training (JIT) program is perfect for them! Sign up by 3:10 to Punxsutawney, and we’ll see you at Bartlett Trophy Lounge! [$\xi$ points for one JIT per team, though any number can attend]

1. An official letter from a professional baseball player or pitcher, thanking you personally for helping create the greatest American pastime. [10 points for minor league, 25 points for major league.]

1. In honor of Casimir Pulaski Day, bring us: goldenrod, a 4H stone, a team member crying in a bathroom along the Great Divide with their shirt tucked in and their shoes untied, and the Lord in your Headquarters window. [Sufjan Ste7ens points]

1. TBA. [11 (or 11, backwards) stniop]

1. TBA. [You know what pointing is funnier than 2.4? 2.5! points] 

1. TBA. [12.23/X points] 

1. Hockney's double portraits are all so \textit{pretty}! We'd just love to have one in our living room—only the people are always a teeeensy bit too far apart. Could you just, y’know, scoot them over a bit, make it less awkward? Maybe put some smiles on their faces? Good art makes people happy, right? [6.7 points]

1. G. L. knows has the ring. I know that you a whole building once. J. C. got into spaceship. G. A. put on a hat. H…man and H…girl went. W. G.’s rabbit ran away from the. That terrible thing is coming us. J. C. got into spaceship. B…girl is a. L. L. hid in his. [10 points]

1.  Very few people know that May 10th is Bring Your Mariachi Band to Work Day. We have a feeling that this year, a lot of people are going to find out. [10 points]

1. A holiday not represented elsewhere on the List, introduced with your team’s holiday tradition on the designated Discord channel at least one month beforehand, and proof you properly celebrated that holiday on the day of. [4 points for your team’s holiday, 1+1 (because it looks like candles) points per other team’s holiday you celebrate.]

1. You honestly believe it’s mere coincidence that Kinbote’s supposed alter ego just so happens to share the name of an Omega Level Telepath? And I “can’t keep disrupting academic conferences like this?” So what exactly do you intend to do about that? …A restraining order? Oh. Well, I’ll show you—I’ll show them all!—with my supercommentary on \textit{Pale Fire} proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Zemblan king delusion was psychically implanted by Professor X. [7.75 points, plus 2.25 points for comments from a Nabokov scholar]

1. A hammer, a bell, and a song (snippet), to be brought all over this Scav and used aloud at appropriately just, free, and love-between-my-brothers-and-my-sisters-y moments, respectively. [11 points]

1. The List was handed down by the Judges on Mount Ida. Surely it is infallible. So when you see an Item from a past List that the masses might consider flawed, you know to use the tricks of the Talmudic trade to show what it must’ve really been asking for. [5 points]

1. Unfortunately, you have to leave seminar a few minutes early. It’s only polite to let your professor know before class and to perform “So Long, Farewell” on your way out. [9 (von Trapps) points for the full song and choreography]

1. Your team’s Rooster Prince seems incurable at every event they attend, until they hear the advice of one wise Judge\dots. [8.5 points]

1. A gig musician only survives by playing what the people want to hear. So at the Fruit Festival, your new-time string band should be able to seamlessly transition between fiddle tune crowd-pleasers and the top hits of 2014(0), i.e. our Theme Songs. [15 points]

1. Use what you learned in shop class to figure out who’s right: Aristotle, Xunzi, or Kant. [9 points] 

1. “My [Items] serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them—as steps—to climb beyond them.” At Judgment, (metaphorically) throw away the List and demonstrate that you see Scav aright. [3 points]

1. Fuck Jefferson Davis Day. We’d rather you celebrate Jefferson Davis Day, which honors Jefferson Airplane’s long-lost epic about Mo’ne, Angela, Vaginal, or UC Davis, with your team’s recording. [9 points]

1. A skin writing tramp stamp, visible at Judgment. [7.5 points]

1. So is Scav any good or not? Your quarterly Scav Review should dodge the question in favor of an interview with a conceptually groundbreaking Scavvie; a formally innovative literary flash fiction that interrogates the meaning of modern Scav; an oblique, abstract photo of one of your Items, and a poem—okay, fine, a poem that actually says what you’ve been doing the past three months. [7.5 points per issue, due by March 1\st, June 1\st, September 1\st, and December 1\st]

1. \textit{x Minus x}, for some x such that emotional impact and distance from the original x is even greater than for x = Garfield. [X points (but like X as in 10)]

1. What’s green, hangs on a wall, and whistles? Show us. [9 points if it does all three]

1. \textit{Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans (jeans) / boots with the fur\dots baggy sweatpants / and the Reeboks with the straps}. I’m glad to know having two pairs of legs didn’t impede Shawty’s ability to get low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low. Show us how it worked with a costumed reenactment at Hutch Courtyard on June 9\th\. [She hit the floor-teen points] 

1. Dear friends and gentle hearts: Don’t Be Idle on the first Federal Observance Day of the year. Join us at the C-Bench and we’ll celebrate All Day Long! If you Can Sing To-night in our Social Orchestra, you’ll Be Home To-morrow with [12 points]. 

1. TBA. [$\eta$ points] 

1. Papa John Paul II. [1 point]

1. The Latke-Hamantash \sout{Debate} \textit{Scav} has been a University of Chicago tradition since \sout{1946} \textit{2014(0)}. \sout{UChicago faculty members} \textit{Scavvies} apply the knowledge and tools of \sout{their disciplines} \textit{Scav} to resolve this age-old question in an evening of fun and frivolity! \sout{Past participants have included Nobel Prize winners and University presidents.} Join us in \sout{Mandel Hall} the Cloister Club on March 17\th\ for yet another attempt to resolve this question once and for all. \sout{Attendance typically soars above 1,000 so come early for good seats!} [$\kappa$ points for your argument for the superiority of a latke- or hamantash-version of any Item; don't forget your homemade groggers for your opponents]

1. Malcolm may be the titular genius, but this is a Dewey stan account. To pay respect to our king, make his magnum opus: the pipe organ made out of trash from S5E16. In the spirit of Dewey's resourcefulness, this Item should be made of whatever garbage you have at your disposal. The mechanism by which sound is made doesn't have to be pneumatic, as long as you are pressing keys to play each note. Most importantly, this instrument shouldn't look like some fancy store-bought organ; it has to be comparable to Dewey's organ in terms of sheer trashiness. [65 points]

1.  Create a 1-2 minute excerpt of an opera about a \textit{dorm}estic occurrence, inspired by Dewey’s opera, \textit{The Marriage Bed}. You need not use your trash organ, but it is what Dewey would do. [9 points, 15 points for using the trash organ to perform]

1. Just like Dewey accompanied his mom during “Mrs. Tri-State,” have a Scavvie whistle your opera excerpt just as beautifully as Lois did to win her the crown. [3 points bc 3 looks like puckered lips]

1. While the children ride the horses on the carousel, all we want is to relax in the carousel nanny chair. Alas! All the nanny chairs are full! Take a normal chair and turn it into a nanny chair-style chair.  I want augmented wood, carving, paint, so we and the other nannies can watch the children on the carousel. [27.5 CURSED POINTS]

1. BLOBBY BLOBBY BLOBBY! Make a text-to-speech feature for everyone’s favorite childhood character, Mr. Blobby. [8LOBBY POINTS]

1. \textit{Rolling Stone} released their ranking of the top 500 songs of all time. Surprising no one, the masterpiece “Hey Ya,” was ranked as the 10th best song ever written. Of course, this means there are exactly nine (9) songs better than Hey Ya, and millions of songs that are nowhere near as good. While \textit{Rolling Stone}’s analysis was more qualitative, what we need is a quantitative analysis. Please create a quantitative scale for precisely how much better or worse any given song on the \textit{Rolling Stone} Top 500 is, demonstrating your scale with at least three other songs. [10.5 points]

1. \textit{The Big Fat Quiz of the (Scavven)Year}. Find this Judge outside Ida Noyes on December 6\th\ to participate. [1 point per correct answer]

1. AntiPapa John Paul II. [-(-1) points]

1. This ain’t no normal Rube Goldberg machine, it’s a real-life music-playing Rube Goldberg machine! Choose the iconic film leitmotif of your choice and make sure each prop is immaculately themed to the film. When you drop your themed ball, the machine should play the leitmotif. [27 points; 0 points for John Williams or Hans Zimmer, not sorry about it]

1. An official Olympic condom, preferably unused. [6.9*3 points + 1 point if it was used by Gus Kenworthy]

1. Some Japanese restaurants will serve \textit{damukare}, i.e. a plate of curry rice where the rice is formed into the shape of the dam to keep everything dry and neat. But even the most plebeian of medievalists know that a single simple moat isn’t enough to protect you from a horde of invaders (or katsu!). Build a fully fortified rice castle that’ll make us say, uh, \textit{damn}. [11 because it looks like the straight pointy things like the spikes on the gate when it comes down? points]

1. シカゴ押し花! Your piece should reflect the environment (within city limits, of course) from which you collected your materials. Be prepared to identify the samples, as picking any threatened or endangered species will send you straight to the EPA jail. [15.5 points]

1. If there are two things that the millennial gays love, it’s coffee and \textit{Drag Race} [citation needed]. And if there’s one thing that RuPaul loves, it’s hydraulic fracturing! [[citation](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/ru-paul-fracking-ranch-drag-race-environment-a9407461.html)] And what is a cup of coffee if not high-pressure injection of water into a substrate? Create a device that simultaneously demonstrates the process of fracking while making a hot cuppa. Oh, and also it is designed to look like a small Wyoming ranch that just so happens to lease mineral rights to oil companies. [35 points]

1. A Uli Kirchler-style pop-up sculpture of a building on campus. [27.5 pop-up points]

[$\sigma$ points]

1. We Judges have been noticing that you’re all getting so close to us, and we’d like a little\dots distance. We’ll provide a small token at List Release---get it as far away from us as possible. Be prepared to provide evidence of every location and route taken by said token. [32 points for the furthest, decreasing points for next furthest, etc.]

1. Don’t honk the honk if you can’t tonk the tonk. A cowboy jacket that, upon pulling on the bolo tie, turns on lights on the back reading “Hot Chicago Nights”. [You reckon a square could get 14.5 points?]

1. Write “Scav Hunt Rules” in some \textit{in situ} snow. You know what the “ink” should be. [thrpee points]

1. Reverse body sushi! Turns out regular body sushi is a moral and public health no-no, so we’re asking for the opposite: a teammate dressed as a piece of sushi, prostrate, covered in an assortment of human body-shaped sushi rolls. [11 points, 0 points for nudity]

1. Tucker Carlson \textit{claims} that windmills are nothing more than silly fashion accessories. To that we say, wait yeah you might be onto something you fuckface.

1. Windmills? No, those are giants! And there is no one tough enough in all of Spain to fight them. Make a reversible earring that displays Don Quixote and his noble steed on one side, but when flipped, reveals Alonzo Quixano and his exhausted horse. [8.85 points]

1. We have seen the Voltorbs of the past and present, but what about the future? Bring your life-sized, futuristic Voltorb to Judgment along with a matching Pok\'e Ball from its era.

1. The costuming in \textit{Starlight Express} sure was fan-track-stic, but we're still rail-ing from the fact that they were missing a key feature: capes! Get it? Capes\dots with trains?! Not just any trains, but ever-lengthening trains, with new train car additions displayed at every Captain's appearance throughout the Hunt. This Groundhog Day, at 3:10 to Punxsutawney, your Captains should arrive dressed as their favorite real or fictional train that's ready to hit the big stage. 3:10 to Punxsutawney will be hosted in Hutch Commons.

1. Sure, we have a shrine to Milton Friedman, but what about the OG? Perform a piano piece written sometime during Adam Smith’s illustrious life.

It's the school bad building, Eckhart Hall. \textit{Eckhart and Eckhardt} tells the story of two buildings separated by architectural sensibilities but brought together by pure animal magnetism and homonyms.

1. Remind us that you can't take it with you, especially when you drown in a pool of excrement. Construct a two-tiered piggy bank themed around the Erfurt latrine disaster. Hoard too many coins in the unstable upper level and risk having them all fall into the unpleasant lower level. [25.5 points]
